# Couera Final Project "Travel Recommendations" for IBM Javascript Programming Essentials 

https://www.coursera.org/learn/javascript-programming-essentials

list.json is the data file, feel free to take it. I can do better or more scraping, though, if you ask for what you want. Gloomy.penguin.kim@gmail.com

just download and run `python3 -m http.server 5000 --bind 127.0.0.1` in the main directory and it will load index.js for you.
